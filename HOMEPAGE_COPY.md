## HERO SECTION

**Headline:** GET REAL HOMEBUYER REPRESENTATION

**Subheadline:** Builder's rep works for builder—who's working for YOU?

**Description:**
When you walk into a builder's sales office, that agent works for the builder. Their job is to get you to pay full price, add upgrades, and close fast. We work exclusively for you—negotiating better prices, protecting your interests, and making sure you actually get what you're paying for.

## PROBLEM SECTION

**Headline:** The Problem Most Homebuyers Don't See Coming

**Description:**
You think you're getting help, but you're actually getting sold. Here's what happens when you work with the builder's agent:

**Point 1: They're Not On Your Side**
The agent showing you that new construction home? They work for the builder. Their commission comes from the builder, not you. So when they say "this is a great deal," they mean it's great for the builder.

**Point 2: You Pay Full Price (Or More)**
Builder agents don't negotiate. Why would they? Their job is to get you to pay asking price, add expensive upgrades, and close quickly. You end up paying thousands more than you should.

**Point 3: You Miss Red Flags**
That contract has clauses that protect the builder, not you. Those upgrades cost way more than they should. That timeline might slip, and you'll have no recourse. A builder's agent won't point any of this out.

**Point 4: You're On Your Own**
Once you sign, you're stuck. If something goes wrong, if the builder delays, if quality isn't what you expected—the agent who "helped" you isn't going to fight for you. They already got paid.

## VALUE PROPS SECTION

**Headline:** What Happens When You Have Someone Actually Working For You

**Description:**
We're exclusive buyer agents. That means we only represent you. No builder relationships. No conflicts of interest. Just someone who fights to get you the best deal possible.

**Value Prop 1: We Negotiate Everything**
Base price, upgrades, closing costs, timeline—we negotiate it all. Builders expect to negotiate, but most buyers don't because they're working with the builder's agent. We change that.

**Value Prop 2: We Review Every Contract**
Builder contracts are written to protect builders. We read every line, explain what it means, and push back on clauses that don't serve you. You'll know exactly what you're signing.

**Value Prop 3: We Save You Real Money**
Between negotiating the base price, getting upgrades at cost, and avoiding unnecessary fees, our clients typically save $10,000 to $50,000 on their new construction purchase. Sometimes more.

**Value Prop 4: We're There Through Everything**
From your first visit to the model home through final walkthrough and closing, we're with you. If something goes wrong, we handle it. If the builder tries to cut corners, we catch it.

## PROOF SECTION

**Headline:** Real Results From Real Homebuyers

**Description:**
People who worked with us instead of going it alone with the builder's agent:

**Testimonial 1:**
"We were about to pay full price for a new build in Summerlin. Our agent negotiated $25,000 off the base price and got us $15,000 in free upgrades. The builder's agent never would have done that—they work for the builder."
— Sarah & Mike, Summerlin Homebuyers

**Testimonial 2:**
"The contract had all these clauses that would have left us with no recourse if things went wrong. Our agent caught them, explained what they meant, and got the builder to remove the worst ones. We would have signed anything without her."
— Jennifer, First-Time Homebuyer

**Testimonial 3:**
"Builder kept pushing back our closing date. Our agent didn't just accept it—she negotiated compensation for our extended rent and got them to commit to a firm date. We would have been stuck without her."
— David & Lisa, Henderson New Construction

## FAQ SECTION

**Headline:** Common Questions

**Description:**
Things people ask before working with us:

**Q: Do I really need my own agent for new construction?**
A: You don't need one, but you should have one. The builder's agent works for the builder. They're not going to negotiate price, point out contract issues, or fight for you if something goes wrong. We do all of that.

**Q: Does this cost me anything?**
A: No. The builder pays our commission, just like they pay their own agent. You pay nothing. The difference is we work for you, not the builder.

**Q: Can I still use the builder's agent?**
A: You can, but you shouldn't. When you use the builder's agent, you're in a dual agency situation. They legally represent both you and the builder, which means they can't fully advocate for either. We only represent you.

**Q: What if I've already talked to a builder?**
A: That's fine. As long as you haven't signed a contract, we can still represent you. We'll handle all future negotiations and make sure you get the best deal possible.

**Q: How much can you actually save me?**
A: It varies, but our clients typically save $10,000 to $50,000 through price negotiation, upgrade discounts, and avoiding unnecessary fees. Sometimes more, depending on the purchase price and what we negotiate.

**Q: What areas do you cover?**
A: We work throughout the Las Vegas Valley, including Summerlin, Henderson, North Las Vegas, and surrounding areas. We know the new construction market across the region.
