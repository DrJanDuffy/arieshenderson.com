    question: "Who is Dr. Jan Duffy?",
    answer:
      "Dr. Jan Duffy is a Nevada-licensed real estate agent (License S.0197614) with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties. She has 30+ years of experience and over $127M in career sales, specializing in exclusive buyer representation for new construction homes across Las Vegas, Henderson, Summerlin, and North Las Vegas.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is an exclusive buyer agent?",
    answer:
      "An exclusive buyer agent represents only the homebuyer in a transaction—never the builder or seller. This eliminates dual agency conflicts and means every negotiation, contract review, and recommendation is made solely in the buyer's interest.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it cost anything to work with an exclusive buyer agent?",
    answer:
      "No. The builder or seller pays the buyer agent's commission as part of their marketing costs, so buyers receive full representation at no cost to them.",
  },
  {
    question: "What areas does Dr. Jan Duffy serve?",
    answer:
      "Dr. Duffy serves the entire Las Vegas Valley, including Summerlin, Henderson, North Las Vegas, and surrounding Southern Nevada communities, with office locations in Centennial Hills, Henderson, Sunset, and Summerlin.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do I need my own agent for new construction?",
    answer:
      "The agent in a builder's sales office works for the builder, not for you. An exclusive buyer agent negotiates the base price and upgrades, reviews the builder contract for one-sided clauses, coordinates inspections, and protects your interests through closing and warranty claims.",
  },
